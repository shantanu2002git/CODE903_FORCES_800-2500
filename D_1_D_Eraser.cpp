/*
!
You are given a strip of paper s
 that is n
 cells long. Each cell is either black or white. In an operation you can take any k
 consecutive cells and make them all white.
>> Find the minimum number of operations needed to remove all black cells.

iterate from left to right with a variable i, and when you see a black cell, you should skip the next kâˆ’1
 cells (because the eraser will take care of them) and increase the number of operations by 1. 
 The answer is the total number of operations.
